# Introduction:

We are living in 21st century where all the work is done using technology and has become an integrated part of life. In this article we proposed the design and implementation of an electric vehicle (EV) charging station finder application developed using Java, HTML, CSS language. Due to the limitation of electrical power distribution network, Electric Vehicles charging stations are limited and to find them is hard for new EV owner. In order to provide information to users about the charging stations and to help user to navigate, it was also created a web application to help the EV owners on these processes. This Proposed EV finder Application helps EV owners to locate a charging station near them and to plan a journey and with many features.

# Technologies:

Java(Servlet,  JSP),
HTML & CSS,
MYSQL Database

# Tools:

Eclipse,
XAMPP

# Conclusion:


The main purpose of the project is to develop a useful product for the EV users which will be very convenient for them. This app will not only provide service to the user, but it will also be used by the vendor (Electric station owners) as an interactive system. It can also generate more data of user which owns the electric vehicles and also the vendors which have charging station. By using this one can used to find as well as to navigate to stations. This app will also be expanded in the future as a commercial product with more features that will also use subscription packs and as well as features like charge and chill which will generate more revenue.
